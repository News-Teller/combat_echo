       "  'WASHINGTON — Vice President Kamala Harris stressed Wednesday that teachers should be given priority for getting Covid-19 vaccinations, but wouldn’t say if she believed that giving them the shots should be a prerequisite for reopening schools.\\n\\nIn her first live one-on-one network interview since taking office, Harris was asked by \"TODAY\" show anchor Savannah Guthrie whether she could reassure teachers that it would be safe for them to go back to school even if they’re not vaccinated.\\n\\n“Teachers should be a priority,” said Harris, adding that teachers “are critical to our children\\'s development, they should be able to teach in a safe place and expand the minds and the opportunities of our children. So teachers should be a priority along with other front-line workers.”\\n\\nHarris said fewer than half the states are prioritizing teachers right now to receive the vaccine.\\n\\nGuthrie noted that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has put out guidance saying that teachers do not have to be vaccinated to go back to school.\\n\\nAsked again if it’s safe for teachers to return to the classroom without being vaccinated, Harris said that states have to decide whether they can institute safe measures, such as social distancing. She emphasized that the key to ensuring that those measures are in place is Congress passing another Covid-19 relief package.\\n\\n“They should be a priority,” Harris said about teachers getting vaccinated, “And the states are making decisions individually about where they will be on the list of who gets vaccinated.”\\n\\nStates are wrestling with the situation as infectious disease experts say schools are not a major source of Covid-19 transmission but many teachers unions oppose reopening them.\\n\\nDuring a Wednesday briefing, the White House\\'s lead Covid-19 coordinator Jeff Zients said that while President Joe Biden and the vice president believe teachers should be placed at the head of the line along with other frontline workers, they both agree with the CDC guideline that vaccinating them is \"not a requirement to reopening schools.\"\\n\\nThe CDC has also released guidance that says the reopening of schools should be tied to the rate of infection in communities. Under that metric, Guthrie said as many as 90 percent of schools might not be able to reopen.\\n\\nWhen asked, Harris wouldn\\'t say if it a mistake for the CDC to make the recommendation, but only said that it\\'s merely a recommendation \"about how to reopen safely if they\\'ve been closed, how to stay open if they\\'ve been opened.\"\\n\\nThe vice president also repeated Biden\\'s statement from Tuesday night at a CNN town hall that his administration\\'s goal is to get as many K-8 schools reopened within the first 100 days of his presidency, allowing students to attend class five days a week.\\n\\n\"The issue here is not just about statistics — it\\'s about our kids, it\\'s about their parents,\" Harris said. \"It\\'s about the fact that every day our kids are missing essential, critical days in their educational development.\"\\n\\n\"Each day in the life of a child is a very long time,\" she continued, \"And that\\'s why we\\'ve got to collectively do everything in our power to reopen our schools as quickly as possible, as safely as possible.\"',\n",

While the CDC has made brief mention of the vaccine’s side effects on pregnancy on its website, publications such as The New Yorker have noted how whether or not to get vaccinated is presenting quite the dilemma to women looking to grow their families.\\n\\nJacobson additionally stressed that she’s not an anti-vaxxer in the least, and that she “fully supports” those who intend to or who have already received the vaccine.\\n\\n“The way I see it, getting the vaccine is for me,” explains Jacobson. “It protects me.

       "  'Life expectancy in the US dropped a full year in the first half of 2020, according to a report published Thursday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Health Statistics. Experts say that Covid-19 was a significant factor contributing to the decline.\\n\\nThe life expectancy for the entire US population fell to 77.8 years, similar to what it was in 2006, CDC data shows.\\n\\nChanges to life expectancy also widened racial and ethnic inequities. Compared to 2019, life expectancy for non-Hispanic Black people in the US fell about three times what it did for non-Hispanic White people, by 2.7 years. It fell by twice as much for Hispanic people, by 1.9 years.\\n\\nLife-expectancy disparities between Black people and White people had been shrinking in recent years, but these latest figures reverse some of that progress.\\n\\nOver the past 40 years, life expectancy has increased slowly but rarely declined. Between 2014 and 2017 — a peak period of the opioid epidemic — life expectancy declined a third of a year, which itself was significant.\\n\\nLife-expectancy estimates before 1980 have been measured less consistently, but experts told CNN that estimates for drops in life expectancy after World War II range from less than a year to three years.\\n\\nThe pandemic has taken a massive toll on the US population. About 490,000 people have lost their lives to the disease, and the CDC estimates excess deaths in 2020 to be even higher..\\n\\n“A year of life expectancy lost doesn’t really give you a true sense of how serious this has been. Millions of life years were actually lost,” Eileen Crimmins, a professor at the University of Southern California who has researched changes in mortality, told CNN. “Covid is on track to cause more deaths than cancer or heart disease, and that’s important.”\\n\\nMost deaths due to Covid-19 have been among older adults, which would have a small effect on overall life expectancy.\\n\\nBut Theresa Andrasfay, a researcher at the University of Southern California who has published work on the potential impact of Covid-19 on life expectancy, notes that while deaths among younger adults may be less common, the numbers are still substantial.\\n\\n“Those deaths have a significant effect on life expectancy because they contribute to more foregone years of life,” she told CNN.\\n\\nDisparities in years lost among Black and Hispanic people are in line with the disproportionate effect Covid-19 has had on communities of color. Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black people are both about twice as likely to die of Covid-19 than non-Hispanic White people, according to the latest data from the CDC.\\n\\n“At the beginning of the pandemic, we may have thought this was a virus that affected everyone equally,” Andrasfay said. “We were aware of these longstanding health disparities, but this really drives home how the Black and Latino communities were disproportionately affected.”\\n\\nThe new life-expectancy estimates from the CDC mark the first time the agency has published these figures using provisional data that comes from death certificates that were received and processed for the first half of 2020.\\n\\nBecause it is based on deaths recorded between January and June, the report notes that the estimates “do not reflect the entirety of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, or other changes in causes of death.”\\n\\nCertain geographic areas were affected more than others earlier in the pandemic, and timely reporting of deaths varies by jurisdiction.',\n",

They shed more virus for longer periods of time.”\\n\\nFlu vaccinations rose 2.6% this year due to 52% of people six months and older receiving the vaccine, but the “flu has been essentially nonexistent” this season, Schaffner said.\\n\\nSchaffner warned that the next flu season could be much worse, with the lack of spread this year, meaning many people won't have naturally built up immunity next fall.\\n\\n“Many of us didn’t get a boost from encountering the flu virus this year, and so we haven’t had a chance to build up our antibodies,” he said. “All the more important to get vaccinated this fall.”\",\n",

       "  'Yet scientists have just discovered that rare-earth materials can actually be found in everyday consumer plastics—including water bottles, children’s toys, yogurt containers, and cosmetic cases. Our disposable plastics are filled with very small amounts of the earth’s most finite treasures. “The irony is they’re extremely valuable,” says Andrew Turner, an associate professor in environmental sciences at the University of Plymouth, who led the study. “They’re critical elements for modern technology. And yet we’re finding that they’re becoming contaminants.” Scientists have understood for some time that our plastics can include unexpected materials. Recycled black plastics, in particular, are commonly infused with dangerous levels of bromine or even lead. That’s because TVs and other plastic-using electronic devices add materials such as bromine as a flame retardant, and that plastic can end up recycled into microwave dinner trays. But this new research, published in Science of the Total Environment, is actually quite different from earlier studies. The first breakthrough was that scientists discovered the presence of rare-earth materials in plastic at all. And in fact, the ratio of rare-earth materials in plastic is almost equal to their distribution in the earth’s crust. “I think it’s fascinating. . . . Plastic is acquiring an almost geological signal in it,” says Turner. “We’re contaminating everything we use.”\\n\\nSecond, this study examined virgin plastics—plastics that were derived from pure petroleum rather than other recycled goods. That means we can’t trace the presence of rare-earth materials back to recycled electronics or other man-made pollutants. They come from an unknown source. What does this research mean? As for what this finding means in a practical sense, “It’s one of those pieces of research that leads to more questions than answers,” Turner admits. First off, we should recognize that this is not a new phenomenon. Turner’s team notes that rare-earth materials can be found in plastic ocean waste, which means that this contamination may have been happening for decades. Plastics are a modern wonder material that arose out of World War II, and much of the core science behind plastic production remained unchanged over the course of the 20th century. “If I were to make a calculated guess, yes, [rare earth materials] have probably been in plastics all along without us knowing about it,” says Turner. Is he concerned that these rare-earth materials are toxic? Not particularly, at least not in the current concentrations researchers have observed (rare-earth materials can be harmful at higher concentrations, as in the mining industry). Does he believe the plastics could be recycled, with the rare-earth materials extracted to be used in electronics? No again. “It wouldn’t be worthwhile recovering [rare earth materials]. The levels are quite small,” says Turner. “It’s not worth melting down a lot of plastic rather than going to a prospective [mining] site.”\\n\\nWhat he does believe is important, however, is in the bigger picture. Examining our production processes could reveal an untapped source of rare-earth materials, which might mitigate some of our need for mining. But even if it doesn’t, Turner insists that we should understand plastic production well enough to be able to pinpoint exactly where these unexpected materials come from. “When we talk about contamination of plastic, even though it’s a small amount, it’s significant because it’s coming from somewhere,” says Turner. “We’ve lost control of what we’re producing.”',\n",

       "  'This is not a “doom and gloom” story or an exaggerated headline. This is the reality for many people in Texas right now. The City of Galveston posted the following statement on its Facebook page, “We still have water available for residents in need. If you need water, swing by McGuire Dent Recreation Center to pick it up. The warming center here is also open so drop in, charge your phone and get some warmth.” However, the part of the post that triggered me was the ending, “Limited to four bottles per resident. First come, first serve.” In that moment, I recognized a teachable moment about the impacts of extreme weather, climate change, and resiliency.\\n\\nAs a climate scientist, I have been receiving questions all week about whether this cold outbreak is related to climate change. My standard answer is that, “It’s February and it’s winter, cold outbreaks can happen.” I also point them to studies that suggest that climate change can lead to more disruptions of the Polar Vortex, which could lead to more extreme cold outbreaks going forward. I know that is counterintuitive to many readers, but much of science can be. However, that discussion is beyond the scope of my intent herein. Associated Press writer Seth Borenstein, this week, offers a great primer on climate change, cold outbreaks and the Polar Vortex.\\n\\nI want to discuss the human toll of extreme weather events. I often cringe when people concerned about climate change go straight to the polar bear narrative or hyperbolic example of the entire Greenland Ice Sheet melting. By the way, I am concerned about the bears too, but extreme weather-climate events impact our lives everyday (and right now). Shirley Williams is a native of Galveston, Texas. When she shared the Facebook post from the city, she said, “This is so heartbreaking. Only 4 bottles of water while supplies last, and that’s if you have transportation to get there.”\\n\\nWilliams was speaking from the perspective of empathy, but her lament is poignant. It captures so many elements of how an extreme weather event impacts daily lives and our well-being. Water is a basic necessity for life, and for many of us, so is heat. The recent winter storm was predicted days to weeks in advance, yet the infrastructure that citizens depend on was not prepared for it. Key energy supply resources in the renewable and natural gas sectors were compromised. Water delivery pipes ruptured. Many roadways were impassable because of ice. Even if you could drive, it was not guaranteed that you could find gasoline or a charge (in the case of electric vehicles). A relative of mine who works in the medical profession in Texas sent this text when I reached out to check on her, “It’s bad here. No power. Water running low. Hospitals full of patients with carbon monoxide poisoning, hypothermia, and burns from house fires.”\\n\\nHer text does not sound like a description of Texas in the year of 2021. It sounds like a war zone or disaster area. Yet, that is exactly what she is describing, and we have seen this before: Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Katrina, California Wildfires, Louisiana Floods of 2016, Chicago Heatwave of 1995, and so on. In 2020 alone, 22 weather-climate events that exceeded $1 billion in coasts, which shatters the previous record of 16 events. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, “Over the last 41 years (1980-2020), the years with 10 or more separate billion-dollar disaster events include 1998, 2008, 2011-2012, and 2015-2020.”\\n\\nWhen I pledged Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity decades ago, I remember the members teaching us the 5 P’s: Prior planning prevents poor performance. If anything, COVID-19 should have been a very bright warning signal. Public health and infectious disease experts warned us decades ago that a pandemic of this scale was looming. Even on the eve of the pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a warning on January 30th, 2020 about the threat of a crippling pandemic. Yet, most countries, including the U.S., ignored WHO recommendations calling for an aggressive test, tracing, and social distancing program.\\n\\nClimate experts have been doing the same with extreme events. Unfortunately, it is often difficult to prompt action until the worst case scenarios are realized. I still recall the faces at the New Orleans Superdome after Hurricane Katrina or the despair in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria. The Center for Climate and Energy Solutions defines climate resilience as, “the ability to anticipate, prepare for, and respond to hazardous events, trends, or disturbances related to climate.” Every government organization, business, school, church, and home needs to build in climate resilience thinking going forward.\\n\\nMany companies have figured this out. Last year, AT&T funded five universities to help communities in the southeastern United States evaluate risks associated with climate change and enable resiliency to the ongoing crisis. AT&T’s website points out that, “Climate change is one of the world’s most pressing challenges, and weather events associated with climate change pose a significant threat to the safety of communities and infrastructure everywhere.”\\n\\nUltimately, the Texas mess is a convergence of many factors, and sadly the political maneuvering has begun. My hope is that proactive thinking is an outcome as we go forward because “four bottles of water” to citizens in need, though an important gesture, is unacceptable.',\n",

       "  'A New York City waitress was fired after she expressed hesitation about taking the COVID-19 vaccine without knowing the effects it might have on women who are trying to get pregnant.\\n\\nAccording to a report from the New York Post, management at Brooklyn restaurant Red Hook Tavern dismissed 34-year-old Bonnie Jacobson after she refused to get the vaccine “immediately” under her boss’s mandatory orders because she wanted to see more research about its compatibility with fertility.\\n\\n“The way I see it, getting the vaccine is for me. It protects me. If I am not getting it, it’s my choice, and I’d only be hurting myself,” she said, a view that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention supports for expectant mothers. The CDC also says currently that the COVID vaccine is “unlikely to pose a risk for pregnant people.”\\n\\nJacobson added that while she “fully supports” people getting vaccinated, she chose “not to get the vaccine because there just isn’t enough data or research at this point on its effects on fertility.”\\n\\nDespite the restaurant’s policy providing vaccine exemptions to people whose “personal health or disability prohibits you from obtaining this vaccination,” Jacobson was still booted to the curb after working a 13-hour shift, in a “shocking” and “hurtful” decision by her employers, considering her commitment to working throughout the pandemic.\\n\\n“I was expecting to be met by the same flexibility and compassion,” she said.\\n\\nWhile tavern managers claimed they “respected her choice,” they also said they were forced to let her go in order to comply with restaurant policy.\\n\\n“We are sad to see you go,” an email from management said. “If you do change your mind, please do not hesitate to let us know.”\\n\\nJacobson, however, said she will not return even when she does receive a COVID-19 vaccination.\\n\\n“It’s a good restaurant, the food is excellent, the money is great [but] I think I want to take a minute for myself,” she said, noting she and her husband are family planning.\\n\\nWhile the restaurant announced it would be changing its policies to better communicate about to who qualifies for an exemption following the incident with Jacobson, the CDC says there are still many unknowns concerning whether vaccinated people can spread the virus. The agency suggests that masks, which the restaurant requires, still be worn “regardless of one’s own immunity.”\\n\\nData from before Americans were even vaccinated also suggests that restaurants in New York only accounted for approximately 1.4 percent of its COVID-19 spread.',\n",

       "  'The latest coronavirus news updated every day including coronavirus cases, the latest news, features and interviews from New Scientist and essential information about the covid-19 pandemic\\n\\nLatest coronavirus news as of 4.45pm on 18 February\\n\\nLife expectancy fell by one year in 2020, helped by the coronavirus\\n\\nLife expectancy in the US fell by one year on average in the first half of 2020, according to figures from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The covid-19 pandemic is likely to be a significant contributor, experts told CNN. US life expectancy is now the lowest it has been since 2006. “Covid is on track to cause more deaths than cancer or heart disease,” Eileen Crimmins at the University of Southern California told CNN.\\n\\nThe fall was seen across ethnic groups but was most pronounced in minorities. Black Americans lost 2.7 years off their life expectancy, and Hispanics lost 1.9 years, while white Americans lost 0.8 years. Life expectancy disparities between Black and white people in the US had been shrinking in recent years but the pandemic has reversed some of that progress. Over the past 40 years, life expectancy had been gradually rising in the US, apart from between 2014 and 2017, when it fell by one third of a year. This has been attributed to the epidemic of opioid misuse in the country, as well as stagnating decline in deaths from heart disease.\\n\\nNew coronavirus infections in England fell by two-thirds between mid-January and the first two weeks of February. The fall shows “lockdown measures are effectively bringing infections down”, said Paul Elliott at Imperial College London in a statement. The figures come from one of the largest and most authoritative surveys of infections called REACT. Currently about one in 200 people are infected in England, a similar level to September. The national R number – the average number of people one person will infect – is estimated to be between 0.69 and 0.76, meaning that infections are falling. The findings are based on more than 85,000 swab tests from randomly selected people. While all areas of England showed declining infections, they fell most steeply in London, the South East and West Midlands, and less steeply in the North West, North East and Yorkshire and the Humber. This could be linked to tougher lockdown rules being introduced earlier in London and the South East, the BBC reported.\\n\\nGreece has agreed to a trial of allowing tourists to enter the country if they have been vaccinated against covid-19, once flights resume. The initial trial will be with visitors from Israel, which has given the coronavirus vaccine to a higher proportion of its population than any other country. Greece’s tourism minister, Haris Theoharis told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that the country is in talks with British officials about how a similar scheme might work with the UK.\\n\\nThe worldwide covid-19 death toll has passed 2.41 million. The number of confirmed cases is more than 110 million, according to Johns Hopkins University, though the true number of cases will be much higher.\\n\\nEverything you need to know about the pandemic\\n\\nWhere did coronavirus come from? And other covid-19 questions answered\\n\\nYou could be spreading the coronavirus without realising you’ve got it\\n\\nWhich covid-19 treatments work and how close are we to getting more?\\n\\nWhat will it take to get a covid-19 vaccine to the world?\\n\\nWhat to read, watch and listen to about coronavirus\\n\\nThe New York Times is tracking hospital bed occupancy in England in an interactive graphic.\\n\\nPanorama: The Race for a Vaccine is a BBC documentary about the inside story of the development of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine against covid-19.\\n\\nRace Against the Virus: Hunt for a Vaccine is a Channel 4 documentary which tells the story of the coronavirus pandemic through the eyes of the scientists on the frontline.\\n\\nThe New York Times is assessing the progress of different vaccine candidates and potential drug treatments for covid-19, and ranking them for effectiveness and safety.\\n\\nHumans of COVID-19 is a project highlighting the experiences of key workers on the frontline in the fight against coronavirus in the UK, through social media.\\n\\nBelly Mujinga: Searching for the Truth is a BBC Panorama investigation of the death of transport worker Belly Mujinga from covid-19, following reports she had been coughed and spat on by a customer at London’s Victoria Station.\\n\\nCoronavirus, Explained on Netflix is a short documentary series examining the on-going coronavirus pandemic, the efforts to fight it and ways to manage its mental health toll.\\n\\nNew Scientist Weekly features updates and analysis on the latest developments in the covid-19 pandemic.

The author, Adam Kucharski, is an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, UK, and in the book he examines how diseases spread and why they stop.\\n\\nUK government plans to send 400,000 tests a day to homes and workplaces\\n\\nRapid coronavirus tests will start being sent out by post next month to allow twice-weekly testing of people without covid-19 symptoms for up to two-thirds of England’s population. The pregnancy-test-style lateral flow assays, which look for viral proteins in a swab from the nose or throat, produce results within half an hour, but they are not as accurate as the slower PCR tests used in labs and clinics. The lateral flow tests are already being used for screening people without covid-19 symptoms in settings such as healthcare, care homes and in certain schools and universities. The number of these tests carried out has increased massively in the past month. The latest planned expansion would involve carrying out more than 400,000 tests a day in homes and workplaces, according to documents seen by The Times. The roll-out would begin before schools open up face-to-face teaching – currently slated for 8 March in England – and the tests would be sent to schoolchildren, their families and teachers, as well as anyone who cannot work at home. It would be accompanied by a campaign to encourage uptake provisionally called “Are you ready? Get testing. Go.”\\n\\nUsing lateral flow tests for mass screening is controversial, because they have a higher false-negative rate than PCR tests. Proponents say lateral flow tests find people who are most infectious. Critics say they miss people who are still capable of transmitting the virus and who are then falsely reassured they are free of the virus, so may behave more riskily. A spokesperson for the UK’s Department of Health and Social Care said their plans for expanding testing have not yet been finalised.\\n\\nFour more symptoms should be added to the list of signs that people need a coronavirus test, researchers say. The new symptoms are fatigue, headache, sore throat and diarrhoea. The existing symptoms that indicate the need for a test are cough, fever or loss of taste or smell. The findings come from an analysis of users of an app called the Zoe Covid Symptom Study, which tracks covid-19 symptoms and cases. Using these extra signs as a trigger for testing would lead to many more people being tested who don’t have the virus, but it would also pick up 40 per cent more coronavirus cases, the researchers have calculated.\\n\\nThe world’s first study that will deliberately infect healthy volunteers with the coronavirus will begin next month. Initially, 90 people aged 18-30 will have a small dose of the virus squirted up their nose and will then be carefully monitored to see how their immune system reacts and to find the smallest dose needed for a mild infection. In future the experimenters will study how effective vaccines are against current and novel variants of the virus, said Chris Chiu at Imperial College London.\\n\\nSouth Africa will this week become the first country in the world to start giving people the Johnson & Johnson covid-19 vaccine. This one-shot jab is effective at preventing severe disease from the coronavirus variant prevalent in that country.\\n\\nThe worldwide covid-19 death toll has passed 2.43 million. The number of confirmed cases is more than 109.6 million, according to Johns Hopkins University, though the true number of cases will be much higher.\\n\\nLatest on coronavirus from New Scientist\\n\\nEverything you need to know about the recombinant virus: What exactly has been discovered? What is a recombination event? And how did New Scientist find out about it? All these and more questions answered in our comprehensive article.\\n\\nWhat do the new coronavirus variants mean for a return to normality? Will the new variants scupper efforts to get life back to normal?\\n\\nNearly two million more people will be added to England’s shielding list\\n\\nAbout 1.7 million people in England will be told to shield and take extra precautions from covid-19 after they were found to be at serious risk of disease or death. They will also be prioritised for covid-19 vaccination. The addition will bring the total number on the UK government’s shielding list to almost 4 million, all of whom are being advised to shield until 31 March.\\n\\nThe people being added to the list have been identified using an algorithm to predict whether a person is at risk of severe disease or death from covid-19. The algorithm incorporates information on age, ethnicity, body mass index, other health conditions and postcode (which is indicative of the level of deprivation). “As we learn more about covid-19, we’re continuously reviewing the evidence,” Jenny Harries, one of England’s deputy chief medical officers, told a briefing on 16 February. “It was very clear that not all of those individuals who were at risk were identified by the binary approach,” she said. Harries said it will be up to the individuals to decide whether to follow the shielding advice or not.\\n\\nAn estimated one in five people in England had antibodies against the coronavirus in the 28 days up to 1 February, suggesting they had previously been infected or had received a covid-19 vaccine, according to the Office for National Statistics. In Wales and Northern Ireland the equivalent estimate was one in 7 and for Scotland it was one in 9 people. People were tested for antibodies as part of the COVID-19 Infection Survey in the UK. In England, people aged 80 and over were most likely to test positive for antibodies with 40.9 per cent testing positive, which is probably due to the high vaccination rate in this group. “It could be tempting to assume that quantifying antibody levels like this tells us the level and distribution of immunity to covid-19 in the population, but we do not know what components of the immune system are required for immunity or how long protection will last,” said Simon Clarke at the University of Reading in a statement.\\n\\nEarly data from vaccinations in Israel indicate that the Pfizer/BioNTech covid-19 vaccine prevents 94 per cent of symptomatic coronavirus infections. The study looked at 600,000 fully vaccinated people and the same number of unvaccinated people. This is a very similar level of effectiveness to that recorded in clinical trials of the vaccine. Israel’s health fund, Clalit, used coronavirus test results extracted from people’s health records to compare numbers of infections between those who had received two doses of the vaccine and those who hadn’t received any doses. There were 94 per cent fewer infections among those who had been vaccinated. Nearly half of Israel’s resident adult population have received at least one dose of covid-19 vaccine so far.\\n\\nThe worldwide covid-19 death toll has passed 2.41 million. The number of confirmed cases is more than 109 million, according to Johns Hopkins University, though the true number of cases will be much higher.\\n\\nLatest on coronavirus from New Scientist\\n\\nMerged variants: The UK and California variants of coronavirus appear to have combined into a heavily mutated hybrid, sparking concern that we may be entering a new phase of the covid-19 pandemic.\\n\\nCoronavirus variants carrying similar mutations detected in the US\\n\\nSeven coronavirus variants carrying similar mutations have been detected in the US. All the variants, reported in a preliminary study, have gained a mutation at the same location in their genome and appear to belong to the same lineage as a virus first sequenced on 1 December, which subsequently became more common. “There’s clearly something going on with this mutation,” Jeremy Kamil at Louisiana State University and co-author of the study, told the New York Times. It isn’t clear if the mutation makes the variants more transmissible, like the B.1.1.7 coronavirus variant first sequenced in the UK, but its location in a gene that influences how the virus enters human cells is concerning. “I think there’s a clear signature of an evolutionary benefit,” said Kamil. The preliminary study was released on a pre-print server and has not been peer-reviewed.\\n\\nUK health minister Matt Hancock revealed that a third of social care workers in England haven’t had a covid-19 vaccine yet, despite being among the first priority groups. “We’ll keep offering and keep contacting people who work in social care,” Hancock told the BBC’s Breakfast show. “Obviously the uptake there is very important,” he said. Separately, a preliminary study found lower covid-19 vaccine uptake among Black, Asian and minority ethnic staff at the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust in England. “These findings give significant cause for concern, as ethnic minority groups (especially those working in healthcare) are at higher risk of infection with [the coronavirus] and adverse outcome from covid-19,” said the report, which has not been peer-reviewed. More than 15 million people have received a dose of covid-19 vaccine in the UK so far, in keeping with the government’s target of offering a first dose of vaccine to four priority groups by mid-February.\\n\\n“We’ll do everything we can” to reopen schools in England by 8 March, UK prime minister Boris Johnson has said, adding: “But we’ve got to keep looking at the data, we’ve got to keep looking at the rates of infection, don’t forget they’re still very high.” The UK government is expected to set out plans for ending restrictions at a briefing on 22 February. Johnson said the government’s plans will be “cautious but irreversible”.\\n\\nThe first travellers required to stay at quarantine hotels in England arrived at London’s Heathrow airport on 15 February. People arriving in the UK from 33 “red list” countries are now required to go into mandatory hotel quarantine for 10 days on arrival, at their own expense.\\n\\nThe worldwide covid-19 death toll has passed 2.4 million. The number of confirmed cases is more than 108 million, according to Johns Hopkins University, though the true number of cases will be much higher.\\n\\nLatest on coronavirus from New Scientist\\n\\nMaking a difference: The unpredictability of covid-19 can make our lives feel out of control, but there are things we can all do to influence our course through the pandemic.\\n\\nVaccinations of people under 70 begin in England next week\\n\\nVaccinators in England can now start giving covid-19 vaccines to people aged between 65 and 69, as long as they have already offered jabs to older and clinically vulnerable people in the top priority groups. “We have been told by NHS England that, in exceptional circumstances, where we have reached other groups, we can move on to cohort five [people aged 65 to 69],” an anonymous doctor told the Guardian. Across the UK, 14 million people had received a first dose of covid-19 vaccine as of 12 February – equivalent to about 20 per cent of the total population.\\n\\nCoronavirus infections appear to be falling across the UK. The Office for National Statistics estimates that about one in 80 people in England had covid-19 in the week up to 6 February, down from one in 65 people the previous week. In Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland the equivalent figures for the most recent week are approximately one in 85, one in 75 and one in 150 people respectively, all down from the previous week’s figures. The latest official estimate of the R number – the average number of people each person with coronavirus infects – puts it between 0.7 and 0.9 for the UK as a whole, indicating the country’s epidemic is shrinking.\\n\\nNeil Ferguson at Imperial College London, who advises the UK government as part of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group, said lockdowns have helped drive down cases. “They’re basically halving about every 17 days at the moment,” he told Politico’s Westminster Insider podcast. Ferguson said it might be possible to reopen at least primary schools in a month’s time. “And if we continue to see then a continued decline without large outbreaks, then perhaps starting to relax other aspects of society the following month,” he added. UK prime minister Boris Johnson has said discussions on reopening schools will happen in the week starting 22 February, with schools potentially able to reopen from 8 March.\\n\\nGermany is imposing strict new border controls due to concern over coronavirus variants, with a ban on travel into the country from the Czech Republic and Austria where the B.1351 and B.1.1.7 variants of the virus were found to be prevalent. Returning residents and certain essential workers will be exempt.\\n\\nFrench health authority Haute Autorite de Sante recommended that people who have already had covid-19 and recovered should only be offered a single shot of covid-19 vaccine. “The single dose of vaccine will act as a reminder,” it said in a statement.\\n\\nThe worldwide covid-19 death toll has passed 2.37 million. The number of confirmed cases is more than 107 million, according to Johns Hopkins University, though the true number of cases will be much higher.\\n\\nLatest on coronavirus from New Scientist\\n\\nOrigin of the virus: Is it credible that coronavirus can stay infectious and jump to humans via frozen food, as findings from a Chinese and World Health Organization investigation suggest?\\n\\nCoronavirus variants: UK health secretary Matt Hancock has ignored government science advice for mandatory quarantine of all visitors, making it unlikely that measures will stop the spread of new variants.\\n\\nGame-changing treatments: Faced with an unknown disease, doctors had to update best practices faster than ever before. Here’s what we now know about gold standard coronavirus treatments.\\n\\nRoche’s arthritis drug tocilizumab found to cut risk of death among patients with severe covid-19\\n\\nThe arthritis drug tocilizumab reduces the risk of death among severely ill covid-19 patients, according to findings from the RECOVERY trial, which has been testing a range of potential treatments for the disease since March last year. The study found that 29 per cent of covid-19 patients who received tocilizumab died within 28 days, compared to 33 per cent of those who did not receive the drug. Treatment with tocilizumab – sold under the brand name Actemra by Swiss company Roche – also shortened the time to recovery and reduced the requirement for mechanical ventilation. The trial included 2022 covid-19 patients randomly allocated to receive tocilizumab in addition to their standard care and 2094 patients allocated to standard care only, which for 82 per cent of all patients in the study included treatment with a steroid, such as dexamethasone. Last year, dexamethasone became the first drug found to reduce death rates in covid-19 patients. The most recent results indicate that tocilizumab provides additional benefits when used with steroids, like dexamethasone. “Used in combination, the impact is substantial,” said Martin Landray at the University of Oxford, one of the lead investigators on the trial. “After dexamethasone (steroids), this is the most significant advance in the treatment of covid,” said Athimalaipet Ramanan at the University of Bristol in a statement.\\n\\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued updated guidance saying people who have been “fully vaccinated” against covid-19 are no longer advised to quarantine if they are exposed to someone who tests positive for coronavirus. This applies to people who have had both doses of a covid-19 vaccine at least two weeks ago. However, the CDC said this does not mean that fully vaccinated individuals should stop taking precautions and added that people who had their shots three months ago or more should still quarantine if they are exposed, since it isn’t known how long protection against covid-19 lasts.\\n\\nUS health officials are advising people in the country to consider wearing two masks on top of each other to better protect themselves against coronavirus infection. A CDC report suggested wearing a cloth mask over a disposable surgical mask or improving the fit of a single surgical mask as ways to boost protection.\\n\\nIt could take six to nine months to produce and deploy covid-19 vaccines that work against new variants of the coronavirus, according to AstraZeneca. The UK-Swedish company made this statement after its current vaccine was found to be less effective against the coronavirus variant first identified in South Africa.\\n\\nThe Guardian reported that more than 40 per cent of staff at the UK’s largest care home provider have not received any doses of covid-19 vaccine.\\n\\nThe worldwide covid-19 death toll has passed 2.35 million.

The four new symptoms were identified by researchers through random swab testing and questioning of more than a million people in England, conducted between June 2020 and January 2021. The researchers found an association between testing positive for the coronavirus and reporting any of these new symptoms or other symptoms previously linked to covid-19, such as a persistent cough, fever or a loss or change in sense of taste or smell.\\n\\nThe more symptoms people had, the more likely they were to test positive, although there was some variation in symptoms across different age groups. Chills were linked with infection across all age groups, whereas headaches were reported mainly in children aged 5-17, appetite loss in adults over 18 and muscle aches in those aged 18-54. Infected 5-17 year olds were also less likely to report experiencing fever, persistent cough and appetite loss, in comparison with adults.\\n\\nThe REACT study also looked at whether reported symptoms changed before and after the B.1.1.7 variant became the dominant variant in the UK. It found that symptoms were largely similar, despite the increased prevalence of B.1.1.7. However, loss or change of sense of smell was less predictive of having covid-19 in January when B.1.1.7 accounted for about 86 per cent of infections, compared with November to December when it was 16 per cent. “As the epidemic progresses and new variants emerge, it’s essential that we keep monitoring how the virus affects people so that testing programmes meet changing needs,” said Joshua Elliott, one of the researchers behind the study at Imperial College London, in a statement.\\n\\nPeople in the UK are going to have to “get used to the idea of vaccinating and revaccinating in the autumn as we face these new variants”, UK prime minister Boris Johnson told parliament on 10 February. Several vaccine manufacturers have confirmed that they are already working on new versions of their covid-19 vaccines to make sure they remain effective. The UK government recently announced a partnership with manufacturer CureVac to rapidly manufacture new vaccines in response to new coronavirus variants if needed. “We believe that they may help us to develop vaccines that can respond at scale to new variants of the virus,” said Johnson.\\n\\nEngland’s deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam said he doesn’t think the B.1351 coronavirus variant first identified in South Africa “is going to be a dominant issue in the next few months”. Speaking on BBC News, Van-Tam said 90 per cent of cases in the UK at the moment are caused by the B.1.1.7 variant, first detected in Kent.\\n\\nSouth Africa is considering selling or exchanging its doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca covid-19 vaccine, according to the country’s health minister. Plans to start administering the jabs were put on hold this week after a small, preliminary study indicated it may not protect against mild or moderate covid-19 caused by the B.1.351 variant.\\n\\nThe worldwide covid-19 death toll has passed 2.34 million.

Antibody tests can confirm your immunity, but they must be the right kind.\\n\\nWHO team in China is investigating theory that coronavirus was spread through frozen food\\n\\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) mission in Wuhan, China has ruled out the possibility that the coronavirus originated in a laboratory, but the team is investigating whether the virus came from frozen food, possibly from outside China. The investigation team leader Peter Ben Embarek said the virus seems to have originated in bats, as originally thought, but it was probably transmitted to humans via an unknown intermediate species, possibly a dead or frozen animal food product. Embarek said it is “extremely unlikely” that the virus escaped from a lab. The WHO mission arrived in China in January and spent four weeks researching the origin of the coronavirus with site visits to the Huanan seafood market, originally suspected as the source of the virus, as well as the laboratories at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which was also being investigated as a potential source. It announced its initial findings at a press briefing in Wuhan on 9 February.\\n\\nPeople arriving in England who are required to quarantine in hotels will be charged a fee of £1750 to cover the cost of their stay, transport and coronavirus tests, UK health minister Matt Hancock announced. People who fail to quarantine face fines of up to £10,000, while those who lie on their passenger locator forms about visiting any of 33 “red list” countries face up to 10 years in jail. Hancock said similar measures are being looked at for the devolved nations. “People who flout these rules are putting us all at risk,” he told parliament on Tuesday. He also confirmed that an enhanced testing regime for all arrivals would start on 15 February, from which point all arrivals will be required to get tested for the coronavirus on the second and eighth days of their 10-day quarantine period.\\n\\nExtra covid-19 testing will begin in parts of Greater Manchester in the UK, following the discovery of four people infected with a mutated version of the B.1.1.7 variant, first identified in Kent. The four people, from two separate households in Greater Manchester, were found to be infected with a virus carrying the E484K mutation. The mutation is concerning, as there is evidence that some covid-19 vaccines may be less effective against the B.1.351 variant, also known as the “South Africa variant”, which has the same mutation.\\n\\nThe NHS covid-19 app has told 1.7 million people in England and Wales to self-isolate since its launch in September. A preliminary analysis by researchers at the University of Oxford and the Alan Turing Institute indicates 594,000 coronavirus cases have been prevented by the app. The app has had about 21.7 million downloads, although internal data suggests about 16.5 million people are currently actively using its contact-tracing tool, according to the BBC.\\n\\nThe worldwide covid-19 death toll has passed 2.32 million. The number of confirmed cases is more than 106 million, according to Johns Hopkins University, though the true number of cases will be much higher.\\n\\nLatest on coronavirus from New Scientist\\n\\nSouth Africa variant: South Africa paused its rollout of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine as it might not be effective against the South African B.1.351 coronavirus variant – but it is still likely to limit the severity of covid-19.\\n\\nResearchers are investigating ways to modify covid-19 vaccines to tackle the South Africa variant and others that emerge\\n\\nUK ministers say work is underway to tweak existing covid-19 vaccines to tackle new variants of the coronavirus including the B.1.351 coronavirus variant, commonly referred to as the “South Africa variant”. On 6 February, a small, preliminary study was reported to show that the Oxford/AstraZeneca covid-19 vaccine may not protect against mild or moderate covid-19 caused by B.1.351. At least 147 cases of this variant have now been detected in the UK. “Our brilliant scientists and medical advisers are now working on the potential for new versions of existing vaccines to offer further protections against covid variants,” Nadhim Zahawi, minister for covid-19 vaccine deployment, wrote in the Telegraph. As a precaution, South Africa – where the variant accounts for about 90 per cent of new coronavirus cases – has put its rollout of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine on hold. However, the study, which has not yet been published or peer-reviewed, was relatively small and did not look at the impact of the vaccine on severe disease or death.\\n\\nSarah Gilbert at the University of Oxford, one of the lead vaccine researchers on the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, said a modified version that is effective against the South Africa variant could be ready to deploy in the autumn. “What we’re seeing from other vaccine developers is that they have a reduction in efficacy against some of the variant viruses,” Gilbert told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show on 7 February, adding that although vaccines may be less effective at reducing cases with new variants, they still appear to be protective against death, hospitalisation and severe disease. Other covid-19 vaccine producers are also working on new versions of their vaccines to make sure they remain effective. “We’re very confident in all the vaccines that we are using, and I think it’s important for people to bear in mind that all of them, we think, are effective in delivering a high degree of protection against serious illness and death, which is the most important thing,” said UK prime minister Boris Johnson, in an interview with Sky News on 8 February. “We will be continuing to study the results, the effectiveness, of the vaccine rollout.”\\n\\nAll people living in the UK will be eligible to receive a covid-19 vaccine regardless of whether they have the legal right to work and live in the country, the UK government said on 8 February. “Coronavirus vaccines will be offered to everyone living in the UK free of charge, regardless of immigration status,” a government spokesperson told Reuters. The government said getting the vaccine would not trigger immigration checks.\\n\\nIreland said it will crack down on travellers returning to the UK from the Middle East via Ireland to avoid recently introduced quarantine rules. The number of people travelling to Dublin from Dubai has risen since the UK added the United Arab Emirates to its travel ban list in January.\\n\\nThe worldwide covid-19 death toll has passed 2.31 million. The number of confirmed cases is more than 106 million, according to Johns Hopkins University, though the true number of cases will be much higher.\\n\\nLatest on coronavirus from New Scientist\\n\\nPandemic burnout: The pressure of the pandemic risks building to burnout, but news that vaccines help stop people catching and spreading the coronavirus offers hope of release.\\n\\nPreliminary results indicate that the covid-19 vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca is effective against the highly transmissible coronavirus variant B.1.1.7, which was first detected in the UK. Researchers at the University of Oxford analysed swabs from vaccine trial participants who had tested positive for the coronavirus between 1 October 2020 and 14 January 2021, to determine the variant of the virus with which they had been infected. They found similar efficacy rates of the vaccine against the B.1.1.7 variant (74.6 per cent effective) and the original virus (84 per cent effective). This is despite the fact that those infected with the B.1.1.7 variant produced fewer antibodies that could neutralise the virus. The results were released online as a pre-print and have not been peer-reviewed.\\n\\nVaccine researchers are investigating ways to modify existing covid-19 vaccines rapidly to ensure continued protection against other new variants as well. “We are working with AstraZeneca to optimise the pipeline required for a strain change should one become necessary,” said Sarah Gilbert at the University of Oxford in a statement. “This is the same issue that is faced by all of the vaccine developers, and we will continue to monitor the emergence of new variants that arise in readiness for a future strain change,” she said. “All viruses accumulate mutations over time, and for influenza vaccines there is a well-known process of global viral surveillance, and selection of strains for an annual update of the vaccines.”\\n\\nCoronavirus cases appear to be falling in most of the UK. The most recent results from a random swab testing survey by the Office for National Statistics indicate positive tests were falling in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland in the week up to 30 January. New infections across the UK as a whole are estimated to be falling by between 2 and 5 per cent each day, and the latest official estimate for the UK’s R number – the average number of people each coronavirus case infects – puts it between 0.7 and 1.0. This is most likely to represent the situation two to three weeks ago, due to a time lag in the data. The UK government said it aims for all people aged 50 and above to have been offered a covid-19 vaccine by May, clarifying earlier comments by a spokesperson for UK prime minister Boris Johnson who on 4 February said the government’s target was “spring”.\\n\\nJohnson & Johnson applied for an emergency use authorisation from the US Food and Drug Administration for its covid-19 vaccine. The company announced last week that the single-dose vaccine had an efficacy of about 66 per cent in phase III trials. If approved, it would become the third covid-19 vaccine authorised for emergency use in the US, after those developed by Pfizer and its partner BioNTech and by Moderna.\\n\\nIsrael announced it will ease lockdown restrictions from 7 am local time on 7 February but will keep its borders closed, after a slight reduction in coronavirus cases. Almost 80 per cent of people over 50 in Israel have received a covid-19 vaccine so far. The country is vaccinating its 9 million citizens at a higher rate than any other nation.\\n\\nThe worldwide covid-19 death toll has passed 2.28 million. The number of confirmed cases is more than 105 million, according to Johns Hopkins University, though the true number of cases will be much higher.\\n\\nUK plans to test effect of giving one dose each of the Pfizer and Astrazeneca covid-19 vaccines\\n\\nA UK trial is aiming to investigate the impact of giving people two different covid-19 vaccines for their first and second doses. Being able to use either vaccine will create more flexibility in the delivery of doses, and help deal with disruption in supplies, said England’s deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam. He said combining two different vaccines in this way could also boost immune responses, potentially leading to better protection against covid-19. The trial, which is being led by researchers at the University of Oxford and funded by the UK government’s vaccine taskforce, will recruit 820 volunteers over the age of 50 who haven’t yet received a covid-19 vaccine. Participants will then receive a first dose of either the vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca or the vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech. Some of them will get the same vaccine again for their second dose four or 12 weeks later and others will get a second dose of the other vaccine, to test the effect of combining the two shots and of different time intervals between doses.\\n\\nUK vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said the country is on track to meet its target of vaccinating all people in the four priority groups against covid-19 by 15 February. He told parliament it has been “an incredible effort” that has “drawn on the hard work of so many”. Last month, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK government aims to have given a first dose of covid-19 vaccine to all those over 70, the most clinically vulnerable people and frontline health and social care workers by 15 February – equivalent to about 15 million people. Across the UK, more than 10.4 million people had received a first dose of covid-19 vaccine as of 4 February.\\n\\nInternational travel was associated with increased death rates in the worst-affected countries during the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a study published in the scientific journal BMJ Open. Tiberiu Pana at the University of Aberdeen, UK, and colleagues analysed the relationship between country-level factors – such as international arrivals, population density and health indicators – and the average increase in daily deaths recorded in early 2020 across the 37 countries with the highest death rates from covid-19. They found that the biggest increase in death rates was associated with international arrivals. An increase of a million international arrivals was associated with a 3.4 per cent rise in the average daily increase in covid-19 deaths.\\n\\nA World Health Organization scientist has said society is unlikely to return to “normal” until 2022. “I think we are going to be well into next year before we see a change – that change is likely to be caused by high coverage of the vaccines,” said Helen Rees, who sits on the WHO’s committee for covid-19. “I think this new normal we all talk about is with us for a very long time,” Rees told BBC Wales Live.\\n\\nThe worldwide covid-19 death toll has passed 2.27 million.

So all of that can be completed in a very short period of time, and the autumn is really the timing for having new vaccines available for use,” he said. Pollard said work is already underway to update the vaccine and increase its efficacy against recently identified coronavirus mutations, such as those in the variants first sequenced in the UK and South Africa.\\n\\nPreliminary results suggest that the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine may reduce coronavirus transmission, in addition to reducing symptomatic covid-19 and severe illness. UK health minister Matt Hancock praised the findings of the study led by researchers at the University of Oxford. The results indicate that two doses of the jab reduce coronavirus infection with or without symptoms by 67 per cent. They also suggest that a single dose of the vaccine is 76 per cent effective at preventing symptomatic covid-19 for three months, with this figure increasing to 82 per cent after two doses. Hancock described the results as “absolutely superb” and said they show that “vaccines are the way out of this pandemic”.\\n\\nA mobile coronavirus testing unit has been set up in the town of Southport in England to test residents for the coronavirus and identify if they have the variant first identified in South Africa.

On Thursday 21 January, SAGE reportedly warned that “reactive, geographically targeted” travel bans couldn’t be relied on to prevent faster-spreading coronavirus variants, such as those identified in South Africa and Brazil, from reaching the UK, adding that: “no intervention, other than a complete, pre-emptive closure of borders, or the mandatory quarantine of all visitors upon arrival in designated facilities, irrespective of testing history, can get close to fully preventing the importation of new cases or new variants.”\\n\\nA Downing Street spokesperson said SAGE did not directly advise UK prime minister Boris Johnson to close borders. Universities minister Michelle Donelan told Sky News that the government “always based our decisions on the best medical and scientific advice” and said “the SAGE advice actually said it would probably be ineffective, in fact, to close the borders, which was the same advice that we got at the time from the World Health Organization”. Johnson announced geographically targeted hotel quarantine measures for travellers returning from 30 countries, including Brazil and South Africa, last week.\\n\\nUK health minister Matt Hancock urged people living in postcodes in England singled out for enhanced coronavirus testing for the so-called South Africa variant to stay at home unless “absolutely essential”. Urgent door-to-door testing for the faster-spreading variant has been deployed after 11 cases with no link to foreign travel were identified in parts of England.\\n\\nInterim results from phase III trials suggest Russia’s covid-19 vaccine is 91.6 per cent effective, and data on the vaccine is being submitted to the European Medicines Agency, according to Kirill Dmitriev, director of the Russian Direct Investment Fund. The results, based on a phase III trial including 21,977 adults, three-quarters of whom received the Sputnik V vaccine, are published in scientific journal the Lancet. Other participants received a placebo.\\n\\nSweden announced it would not recommend the covid-19 vaccine developed by the University of Oxford in partnership with AstraZeneca for people aged over 65, hours after Poland said it would not offer the vaccine to over 60s. Last week, medical experts in Germany and Austria made similar recommendations, citing a lack of data in this age group. The European Medicines Agency authorised the vaccine for use in all adult age groups across the European Union and June Raine, chief executive of the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, last week said: “Current evidence does not suggest any lack of protection against covid-19 in people aged 65 or over. The data we have shows that the vaccine produces a strong immune response in the over-65s.”\\n\\nThe worldwide covid-19 death toll has passed 2.24 million.

Urgent testing of adults, regardless of symptoms, will take place in some postcodes in Hertfordshire, Surrey, Kent, Walsall, Sefton and in the London boroughs of Merton, Haringey and Ealing. “We are trying to contain this so it does not spread,” Susan Hopkins, senior medical adviser at Public Health England told the BBC. Any newly identified infections will be analysed to see if they are caused by the highly transmissible coronavirus variant first sequenced in South Africa.\\n\\nUK health minister Matt Hancock “has ordered an attempt at eradication of the new variant if at all possible”, with public health officials starting to go door-to-door in affected areas this week, according to a briefing seen by the Guardian. “This is a precautionary measure,” said Ruth Hutchinson, director of public health for Surrey, in a statement. “The more cases of the variant we find, the better chance we have at stopping it from spreading further,” said Hutchinson, adding: “It’s really important to say that there is currently no evidence that this variant causes more severe illness, so you don’t need to worry.”\\n\\nA covid-19 vaccine has now been offered to older residents at every eligible care home in England, the NHS announced, but vaccination rates of care home staff are lagging behind residents. Fiona Carragher, director of research and influencing at Alzheimer’s Society told the BBC she remained concerned that the vaccination rollout for care home staff “has not been nearly so effective”. In January, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK government aims to vaccinate all those over 70, the most clinically vulnerable people and frontline health and social care workers by 15 February – equivalent to about 15 million vaccinations. Across the UK, more than 8.9 million people had received a first dose of covid-19 vaccine as of 30 January.\\n\\nThe European Union said AstraZeneca has agreed to supply it with 9 million additional doses of its covid-19 vaccine, developed in partnership with the University of Oxford. This brings the total number of expected doses for the first quarter of this year to 40 million, which is about half of what the EU was originally expecting. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen tweeted saying the company would expand its manufacturing capacity in Europe, and start delivering doses a week earlier than scheduled.\\n\\nGermany’s health minister Jens Spahn hinted that covid-19 vaccines from China and Russia could be used in Europe to compensate for the shortfall of doses supplied by Pfizer and its partner BioNTech, and by Oxford/AstraZeneca. “Regardless of the country in which a vaccine is manufactured, if they are safe and effective, they can help cope with the pandemic,” Spahn told German media on Sunday, adding that any vaccine will first need to be approved by the European Medicines Agency.\\n\\nThe worldwide covid-19 death toll has passed 2.23 million. The number of confirmed cases is more than 103 million, according to Johns Hopkins University, though the true number of cases will be much higher.\\n\\nLatest on coronavirus from New Scientist\\n\\nCan vaccines stop transmission?: Several studies suggest that coronavirus vaccines can significantly reduce transmission of the virus, but not halt it completely – so social distancing is still necessary.\\n\\nA coronavirus vaccine developed by the US firm Novavax has been shown to be 89 per cent effective in preventing covid-19 in clinical trials. The trials included participants in the UK and South Africa, and found the vaccine to be 86 per cent effective against the UK variant of the virus, but only 60 per cent effective against the variant in South Africa. Novavax said it will immediately begin development on a vaccine specifically targeted to the South African variant.\\n\\nJanssen, a subsidiary of US firm Johnson & Johnson, announced that its covid-19 vaccine showed 66 per cent efficacy in an international trial. These results are based on a single dose of the vaccine, which makes it easier to administer than the two-shot vaccines that have already been approved. The company has said it will sell its vaccine on a not-for-profit basis.\\n\\nThe UK has already ordered 30 million doses of the Janssen vaccine and the European Union has ordered 400 million. The UK has also ordered 60 million doses of the Novavax jab.\\n\\nThe European Medicines Agency has recommended the approval of the Oxford/AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine for all adults, which will allow mass use of the vaccine in the European Union. Yesterday, a German committee recommended against approving the vaccine for people over 65 because of insufficient data in the trials, but the EMA’s experts said protection could be expected in this group and there is reliable information on safety. The vaccine is already the subject of a dispute between AstraZeneca and the EU over the firm’s decision to supply fewer doses to the EU this year than initially agreed. Today, the European Commission published parts of its contract with AstraZeneca, which it says obliges the company to supply the agreed volumes. The drug-maker says the contract only obliges it to make its “best effort” to meet the EU demand, not to stick to a specific timetable. The EU also announced export restrictions on vaccines made within the bloc in response to the planned cut in deliveries.\\n\\nThe coronavirus variant from South Africa – which is more infectiousness than the original variant – has been detected in the US for the first time, with two cases confirmed in South Carolina.\\n\\nThe New York state government has released new figures showing that it undercounted deaths from covid-19 in nursing home residents by more than 3800. The state’s overall death toll has not increased, but the higher tally in nursing homes has fuelled criticism that governor Andrew Cuomo did not do enough to protect those residents.\\n\\nIn the UK, covid-19 hospital admissions fell to 33.51 per 100,000 people from a rate of 35.64 in the week ending 24 January, figures from the Office for National Statistics show. One in 55 people in private households in England tested positive for covid-19 between 17 and 23 January, which is similar to the previous week. The infection rate was roughly one in 70 in Wales, one in 50 in Northern Ireland and one in 110 in Scotland. The R number for the UK is between 0.7 and 1.1, according to the latest estimate by the government’s scientific advisory group. The R number is the number of people each person with covid-19 will go on to infect.\\n\\nLatest on coronavirus from New Scientist\\n\\nGlobal vaccine distribution: While mass immunisation programmes are making rapid progress in rich nations, many middle-income countries have only just begun roll-outs and most low-income ones will take months to get started. These delays increase the risk of mutations leading to variants that are more transmissible,and may render vaccines less effective in future.\\n\\nThe worldwide covid-19 death toll has passed 2.19 million. The number of confirmed cases is more than 101 million, according to Johns Hopkins University, though the true number of cases will be much higher.',\n",

It had previously made it more difficult to see vaccine misinformation by “downranking” it, which makes it less visible in news feeds.\\n\\nAmid the years-long spat between the tech giants, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in 2018 didn’t mince words when talking about rival Apple.\\n\\n“We need to inflict pain,” he told his team, pointing out how terribly Apple was treating the company, according to people who were familiar with the exchange.\\n\\nThe Wall Street Journal added that particular squabble involved Apple’s “glib” comments regarding the highly sensitive topic of the company’s data collection practices.\\n\\nToday, the most recent feud has branched out to privacy notifications that Apple plans to include in the iOS 14 operating system for iPhones. Those notifications prompt users to give permissions to apps that want to track their activity—a change that Facebook fears would hurt its ad-driven business model.\\n\\nThe company said in a statement that Apple’s prompts do not provide the necessary context about the overall benefits of personalized advertisements.\\n\\n“To help people make a more informed decision, we're also showing a screen of our own, along with Apple’s. It will provide more information about how we use personalized ads, which support small businesses and keep apps free,” the social media giant said in a statement.\\n\\nRecently, Apple CEO Tim Cook linked Facebook’s business model, which has long tapped into data to serve targeted ads, with real-world violence and public distrust in coronavirus vaccines.\\n\\n“If a business is built on misleading users, on data exploitation, on choices that are no choices at all, it does not deserve our praise. It deserves scorn,” he said in a speech at a data privacy conference in Brussels.\\n\\nHe also criticized recommendation algorithms that can suggest certain extremist groups to Facebook’s users, adding that he believes that some companies, in an effort to boost engagement, reward content that undermines trust in public health initiatives like the current mass vaccination campaigns.\\n\\n“At a moment of rampant disinformation and conspiracy theories juiced by algorithms, we can no longer turn a blind eye to a theory of technology that says all engagement is good and the longer the better,” Cook said.\\n\\nFacebook also announced that it would start removing posts that contain false claims about vaccines. It had previously made it more difficult to see vaccine misinformation by “downranking” it, which makes it less visible in news feeds.\\n\\nBut now, such posts will be taken down entirely if the claims had been discredited or contradicted by reputable health agencies like the World Health Organization, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\\n\\n“Given the recent news that COVID-19 vaccines will soon be rolling out around the world, over the coming weeks we will start removing false claims about these vaccines that have been debunked by public health experts on Facebook and Instagram,” the company said in a blog post.\\n\\nEthen Kim Lieser is a Minneapolis-based Science and Tech Editor who has held posts at Google, The Korea Herald, Lincoln Journal Star, AsianWeek, and Arirang TV.

       "  'A mother trying to protect herself and her family from the novel coronavirus ended up being duped by false information that led her to drink her own urine.\\n\\nFor four days, the British woman and her four children gulped down their own urine, believing it would protect them from COVID-19, according to a report by the City of Westminster.\\n\\nUrine is a waste product of the body. Its consumption is generally frowned upon in westernized medicine, according to a 2015 study conducted by the Journal of Clinical and Aesthetic Dermatology.\\n\\nUrine contains high concentrations of toxins and salt that the body has already rid itself of. Once outside of the body, urine quickly attracts more bacteria. Consuming it can cause a person harm.\\n\\nThe British woman told officials she was convinced to drink her pee by a trusted friend or relative, who had served as the mom’s primary source of pandemic-related news.\\n\\nThe mother said she puts her faith in natural cures. Even so, the medical community hasn’t yet recognized anything as a cure for COVID-19.\\n\\nTo date, vaccines are the only thing clinically proven to prevent COVID-19 illness. But the mom cited a debunked conspiracy theory involving Bill and Melinda Gates when voicing her distrust of vaccines.\\n\\nMisinformation has proven to be a detriment to public health throughout the pandemic. Aside from drinking urine, many so-called cures or preventative measures have proven futile.\\n\\nOne of the most notable false cures made headlines last spring when former President Donald Trump mused aloud about ingesting bleach to combat the virus.\\n\\nThis prompted fierce backlash from health officials, political rivals and bleach manufacturers, but their efforts fell short.\\n\\nJust days later, officials began reporting cases of people drinking cleaning products in an attempt to protect themselves from the coronavirus.\\n\\nThis story was reported from Atlanta.',\n",
